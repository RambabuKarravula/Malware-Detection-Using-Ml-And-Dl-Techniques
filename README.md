# Malware-Detection-Using-ML-And-DL-Techniques
- This is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) program to train Malware Detection ML Model and check if a given file is a probable MALWARE or not!
- I have implemented using
  - Streamlit app

NOTE: Don't run any files inside malwares folder, as these are actual malwares taken from [GitHub](https://github.com/Pyran1/MalwareCollection).

## Requirements (installable via pip)
- For running CLI app:
  - [joblib](https://pypi.org/project/joblib/) 
  - [pefile](https://pypi.org/project/pefile/) 
- For running Streamlit app:
  - [streamlit](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/)
  - joblib
  - pefile
- For training your own model:
  - [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) 
  - [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) 
  - [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
  - joblib 
  - pefile 

## What I used?
1. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
   - RandomForestClassifier
   - ExtraTreesClassifier
2. [Malware Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/malware-detection/data) - The raw data here was obtained from the malware security partner of Meraz'18 - Annual Techno Cultural festival of IIT Bhilai, the said raw data constituted malware and legitimate files.
3. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - for GUI - Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams.
4. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - for distributed system - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

## How to run the program?
